This repository is a contains necessary code to scRNA-seq data presented in our manuscript, "Sexual dimorphism in obesity is goverened by RELMa-regulation of adipose macrophages and eosinophils." The primary objective of this study is to better udnerstand sex differences in immune cell activation that drives obesity-mediated pathologies and to understand a female-protective role in this process.

Code is available here. Transcriptome data is available through GEO GSE219119.
